# TeamGenerator
CS 463 Homework 1

This program's purpose is to create random teams based on user input. My first iteration of this program, 
took in number of teams instead of team size, but that was changed to align with project requirements. In the future, 
I would like to create a radio option for the user to chose between dividing teams by either team size or number of teams as well 
as an export option which could save the teams divided into a .txt file so that one could copy and paste it into a document or email. 

I designed this program to look like a mobile application with a simple design sans navigation bar and distrating labels, even though this will be used on a computer. I would someday like to rewrite this for mobile/tablet. 

Tools used in this program are:

ChatGPT

MDN Web Docs

Canva (Design inspiration)
